## 2. What is JavaScript?

 **JavaScript** is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser and works alongside HTML and CSS. Common uses include form validation, animations, dynamic content updates, and building web applications.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

**Git and GitHub** solve these three main problems:

1. **Version Control** – Track and manage changes to code over time.
2. **Collaboration** – Let multiple developers work together without conflicts.
3. **Backup & Access** – Store code safely online and access it from anywhere.


## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

**Forking** a repository creates a personal copy of it on your GitHub account, allowing you to freely make changes without affecting the original. It's commonly used for contributing to projects or experimenting safely.


## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

**Cloning** a repository downloads the entire project (files and history) to your local computer, allowing you to work on it offline and sync with the original repository.


## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request** is a request to merge your changes from one branch or fork into another. It lets others review and discuss your code before it’s added to the main project. It’s commonly used for collaboration and code review.
